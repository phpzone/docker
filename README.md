A Docker command builder configured by [YAML], based on [PhpZone]. Its primary purpose is to
provide a simple way to define commands for running Docker containers/instances which could be used in daily workflow
of every developer. Since now not all developers need to have a knowledge about Docker but still everyone can simply
understand what is running. It is not only about the knowledge but also experienced developers can find an advantage
in keeping ready-made commands.

**This tool is only a configurator and executor of Docker commands, it means applications [Docker] and
[Docker Compose] are not included.**

## Basic Usage

An example speaks a hundred words so letâ€™s go through one.

The configuration file below is used for the development of this extension:

Create a `phpzone.yml` file in the root of a project:

```yaml
extensions:
    PhpZone\Docker\DockerCompose: # register an extension with a configuration
        db:
            description: Run DB which can be used for running tests
            name: myproject
            file: docker-compose.yml
            command: up
```

and run:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/phpzone db
```

This will compose a proper Docker Compose command `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -p myproject up` and
execute it.

## Development

To run tests, run:

```bash
$ composer test
```
